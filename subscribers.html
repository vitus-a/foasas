<p>With the <b>2020 Manifesto for Fair Open Access Publishing in South Asian Studies,</b> we, the undersigned scholars, declare our support for Fair Open Access publishing in classical and modern South Asian Studies. We are aware that this project will take time and that the old structures cannot be replaced today, or by tomorrow. We firmly believe, however, that the transition to this form of publishing is the best way forward in the long-term and that the time and effort needed in order to realize it are worth it. </p>
